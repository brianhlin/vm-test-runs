# This script takes the results of a set of test runs and uploads them via
# passwordless SSH to the local drive of a machine hosted by the UW CSL. This
# is part of a two-step process to put the results on the VDT web site -- the
# second step being copying the files from the local drive to AFS. The reason
# this cannot be done in a single step is that an SSH session using
# passwordless authentication cannot get an AFS token and would not be able to
# access AFS.

# Assume that we are in the run directory.

#    ssh-keygen -f test_result_upload.key -C "VMU test result upload key for `whoami`@osghost"
# and must be generated __with no passphrase__
# Both the .key and the corresponding .pub file should be placed into ~/.ssh.
# In addition, the .pub file should be scp'ed to the $UPLOAD_MACHINE and appended
# to the .ssh/authorized_keys file of the user $UPLOAD_USER.
# The key must have 0600 / 0400 perms and be owned by you.
